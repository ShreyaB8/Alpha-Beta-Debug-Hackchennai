### What

#### We at team Alpha Beta Debug, propose a Web-application which is educative, personalized and most importantly affordable. Our web-app called 'Webin-AR' serves the purpose of educating and helping the students as well as the teachers during the current situation of the global pandemic. This web-app covers from pre primary till sr.secondary education. It helps the students to learn and visualize basic concepts. We do not store any essential data, as Security of the system is one of our priority. The WebApp provides minimalist interface aimed at users from all age groups.

#### With our product, we have implemented a full fledged classroom experience for the students as well as teachers. We have created separate portals for the faculty and students. Once everyone has signed up to the web-app. The user can simply login using their credentials to their respective portal. 

#### The faculty portal will be having a video call feature named 'Webin-AR Meet', where the teacher will be starting the class from one end and the students can join using the classroom credentials given by the teacher. The video call feature allows a better interaction between the teacher and students which is lacking at this time of the pandemic. The video call is secure and by using an App ID and a Token ID,students can only then join the class.

#### The faculty portal also has a feature of voice detection
